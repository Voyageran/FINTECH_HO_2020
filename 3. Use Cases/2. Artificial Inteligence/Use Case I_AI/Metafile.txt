Abstract
The usage of cryptocurrencies, together with that of financial automated
consultancy, is widely spreading in the last few years. However, automated
consultancy services are not yet exploiting the potentiality of this nascent
market, which represents a class of innovative financial products that can
be proposed by robo-advisors. For this reason, we propose a novel approach
to build efficient portfolio allocation strategies involving volatile financial instruments
such as cryptocurrencies. In other words, we develop an extension
of the traditional Markowitz model which combines Random Matrix Theory
and network measures, in order to achieve portfolio weights enhancing
portfolios’ risk-return profiles. The results show that overall our model overperforms
several competing alternatives, maintaining a relatively low level of
risk.
