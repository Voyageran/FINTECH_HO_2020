Also, the envisaged length of the workshop (16h) is not feasible nor desirable. Should be organised in a more efficient way and much more hands on and related to the mission of the regulators

For the upcoming AI SupTech, we demand another much more tailored approach and are trying to work together with Bhive and Lux to achieve this.
