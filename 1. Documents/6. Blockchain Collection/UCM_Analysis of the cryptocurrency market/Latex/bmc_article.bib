	abstract = {Unlike conventional clustering, fuzzy cluster analysis allows data elements to belong to more than one cluster by assigning membership degrees of each data to clusters. This work proposes a fuzzy C- medoids algorithm to cluster time series based on comparing their estimated quantile autocovariance functions. The behaviour of the proposed algorithm is studied on different simulated scenarios and its effectiveness is concluded by comparison with alternative approaches.},

	abstract = "In this paper, following the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) approach and the fuzzy theory, we propose a clustering model for financial time series based on the estimated cepstrum which represents the spectrum of the logarithm of the spectral density function. Selecting the optimal set of financial securities to build a portfolio that aims to maximize the risk-return tradeoff is a largely investigated topic in finance. The proposed model inherits all the advantages connected to PAM approach and fuzzy theory and it is able to compute objectively the cepstral weight associated to each cepstral coefficient by means of a suitable weighting system incorporated in the clustering model. In this way, the clustering model is able to tune objectively the different influence of each cepstral coefficient in the clustering process. The proposed clustering model performs better with respect to other clustering models. The proposed clustering model applied to each security sharpe ratio provides an efficient tool of clustering of stocks."

	abstract = {In this paper we propose different robust fuzzy clustering models for classifying heteroskedastic (volatility) time series, following the so-called model-based approach to time series clustering and using a partitioning around medoids procedure. The proposed models are based on a GARCH parametric modeling of the time series, i.e. the unconditional volatility and the time-varying volatility GARCH representation of the time series. We first suggest a timid robustification of the fuzzy clustering. Then, we propose three robust fuzzy clustering models belonging to the so-called metric, noise and trimmed approaches, respectively. Each model neutralizes the negative effects of the outliers in the clustering process in a different manner. In particular, the first robust model, based on the metric approach, achieves its robustness with respect to outliers by taking into account a robust distance measure; the second, based on the noise approach, achieves its robustness by introducing a noise cluster represented by a noise prototype; the third, based on the trimmed approach, achieves its robustness by trimming away a certain fraction of outlying time series. The usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed clustering models is illustrated by means of a simulation study and two applications in finance and economics.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the topic of classifying financial time series in a fuzzy framework proposing two fuzzy clustering models both based on GARCH models. In general clustering of financial time series, due to their peculiar features, needs the definition of suitable distance measures. At this aim, the first fuzzy clustering model exploits the autoregressive representation of GARCH models and employs, in the framework of a partitioning around medoids algorithm, the classical autoregressive metric. The second fuzzy clustering model, also based on partitioning around medoids algorithm, uses the Caiado distance, a Mahalanobis-like distance, based on estimated GARCH parameters and covariances that takes into account the information about the volatility structure of time series. In order to illustrate the merits of the proposed fuzzy approaches an application to the problem of classifying 29 time series of Euro exchange rates against international currencies is presented and discussed, also comparing the fuzzy models with their crisp version.},

	abstract = "Detection of power-law behavior and studies of scaling exponents uncover the characteristics of complexity in many real world phenomena. The complexity of financial markets has always presented challenging issues and provided interesting findings, such as the inverse cubic law in the tails of stock price fluctuation distributions. Motivated by the rise of novel digital assets based on blockchain technology, we study the distributions of cryptocurrency price fluctuations. We consider Bitcoin returns over various time intervals and from multiple digital exchanges, in order to investigate the existence of universal scaling behavior in the tails, and ascertain whether the scaling exponent supports the presence of a finite second moment. We provide empirical evidence on slowly decaying tails in the distributions of returns over multiple time intervals and different exchanges, corresponding to a power-law. We estimate the scaling exponent and find an asymptotic power-law behavior with 2<α<2.5 suggesting that Bitcoin returns, in addition to being more volatile, also exhibit heavier tails than stocks, which are known to be around 3. Our results also imply the existence of a finite second moment, thus providing a fundamental basis for the usage of standard financial theories and covariance-based techniques in risk management and portfolio optimization scenarios."

We employed a rich set of established empirical approaches, including a VAR framework, a copulas approach, and non-parametric drawings, to capture a dependence structure. Using a weekly dataset from 2013 to 2017, our key results suggest that the frequency of Google searches leads to positive returns and a surge in Bitcoin trading volume. Shocks to search values have a positive effect, which persisted for at least a week.

	abstract={ Forecasting stock market returns is one of the most effective tools for risk management and portfolio diversification. There are several forecasting techniques in the literature for obtaining accurate forecasts for investment decision making. Numerous empirical studies have employed such methods to investigate the returns of different individual stock indices. However, there have been very few studies of groups of stock markets or indices. The findings of previous studies indicate that there is no single method that can be applied uniformly to all markets. In this context, this study aimed to examine the predictive performance of linear, nonlinear, artificial intelligence, frequency domain, and hybrid models to find an appropriate model to forecast the stock returns of developed, emerging, and frontier markets. We considered the daily stock market returns of selected indices from developed, emerging, and frontier markets for the period 2000–2018 to evaluate the predictive performance of the above models. The results showed that no single model out of the five models could be applied uniformly to all markets. However, traditional linear and nonlinear models outperformed artificial intelligence and frequency domain models in providing accurate forecasts.},

	abstract = "The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Many of the research efforts in this context have focused on introducing new representation methods for dimensionality reduction or novel similarity measures for the underlying data. In the vast majority of cases, each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimental study re-implementing eight different time series representations and nine similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this article, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. In addition to providing a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, our experiments also indicate that, in some cases, certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.",

	abstract = {Executive Summary.The financial crisis that followed the meltdown of the U.S. subprime mortgage market and the subsequent Great Recession were characterized by exceptionally large falls in house prices, as well as unprecedented levels of economic uncertainty. Against this background, we examine dynamic correlations between housing market returns and the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index developed by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012), controlling for economic and financial fundamentals. We find negative correlations throughout the 1987–2014 period. More importantly, correlations are time-varying and tend to increase sharply in times of high economic uncertainty, notably around U.S. recessions. This implies that tail risks, or the probability of unusually large losses for investors in real estate and related securities following spikes in uncertainty, are significant.},

Bitcoin has achieved only scant consumer transaction volume, with an average well below one daily transaction for the few merchants who accept it.  Its volatility is greatly higher than the volatilities of widely used currencies, imposing large short-term risk upon users.  Bitcoin's daily exchange rates exhibit virtually zero correlation with widely used currencies and with gold, making bitcoin useless for risk management and exceedingly difficult for its owners to hedge.  Bitcoin prices of consumer goods require many decimal places with leading zeros, which is disconcerting to retail market participants.  Bitcoin faces daily hacking and theft risks, lacks access to a banking system with deposit insurance, and it is not used to denominate consumer credit or loan contracts.  Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than a currency.},

	abstract = {We introduce a technique to filter out complex data sets by extracting a subgraph of representative links. Such a filtering can be tuned up to any desired level by controlling the genus of the resulting graph. We show that this technique is especially suitable for correlation-based graphs, giving filtered graphs that preserve the hierarchical organization of the minimum spanning tree but containing a larger amount of information in their internal structure. In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to 0), triangular loops and four-element cliques are formed. The application of this filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the U.S. equity markets shows that such loops and cliques have important and significant relationships with the market structure and properties.},

	abstract="When dealing with multiple clustering solutions, the problem of extrapolating a small number of good different solutions becomes crucial. This problem is faced by the so called Meta Clustering [12], that produces clusters of clustering solutions. Often such groups, called meta-clusters, represent alternative ways of grouping the original data. The next step is to construct a clustering which represents a chosen meta-cluster. In this work, starting from a population of solutions, we build meta-clusters by hierarchical agglomerative approach with respect to an entropy-based similarity measure. The selection of the threshold value is controlled by the user through interactive visualizations. When the meta-cluster is selected, the representative clustering is constructed following two different consensus approaches. The process is illustrated through a synthetic dataset.",

	abstract = {An exact test of significance of the hypothesis that the row and column effects are independent in an r × c contingency table can be executed in principle by generalizing Fisher's exact treatment of the 2 × 2 contingency table. Each table in a conditional reference set of r × c tables with fixed marginal sums is assigned a generalized hypergeometric probability. The significance level is then computed by summing the probabilities of all tables that are no larger (on the probability scale) than the observed table. However, the computational effort required to generate all r × c contingency tables with fixed marginal sums severely limits the use of Fisher's exact test. A novel technique that considerably extends the bounds of computational feasibility of the exact test is proposed here. The problem is transformed into one of identifying all paths through a directed acyclic network that equal or exceed a fixed length. Some interesting new optimization theorems are developed in the process. The numerical results reveal that for sparse contingency tables Fisher's exact test and Pearson's χ2 test frequently lead to contradictory inferences concerning row and column independence.},
