In this context, fast adaptation of the technology can also lead to increased cooperation between traditional financial intermediaries and Fintech companies. In addition to this, Big Data is likely to have positive implications on the availability and affordability of financial products and services for some consumers","P2P may offer many opportunities including greater convenience, lower transactional costs, wider access to credit, etc. However, the business model carries inherent risks. From the perspective of investors, they are at risk of losing their investment whereas borrowers are at risk of capital drying up or becoming more expensive in the event of a shrinking in the investor pool. From a financial stability context, several concerns are identified. First, the source of funding is very sensitive to investors remaining confident in the platforms. Second, under most business models, investors cannot rely on deposit insurance and further, it is not clear how they are protected in the event of platform failure. Finally, P2P platforms receive revenues in proportion to the loan volume originated. They therefore want to maximize volume even at the expense of credit standards which in turn can lead to bad debt accumulation.","Many regulatory and supervisory bodies have considered the risk and benefits of innovative business models in the credit space. Furthermore, they have also tried to either integrate novel business models in existing legislation or propose new legislation addressing some of the risk. However, some issues still remain. There are problematic incentives for platforms that rate credit and originate loans without holding the risk of these loans. In addition, when investor returns are guaranteed by platforms, investors have no incentive to distinguish among risk categories. In the context particularly of the difference in risk management, big data can help improve risk management practices or specifically, improve credit risk estimation. In terms of how, this can be achieved either by incorporating more data in the scoring or through better methodologies that are also a side product of big data technological progress.","Use of Big Data for Central banks:
- Use of internet-based data to capture depositors’ expectations or more specifically, use of Google searches to predict deposit run on banks.
- Automatic internet data collection of sale prices for selected elements within the inflation figures for the purpose of forecasting short-run inflation developments. ",#NV,1558342160

Madrid, Spain",2019-06-10,Complutense University of Madrid,Bank of Spain,Javier Arroyo Gallardo,Miller Janny Ariza,#NV,25,Use case I: Network based scoring models to improve credit risk management in P2P lending,Use case II: Factorial network models to improve P2P credit risk management,Use Case IV: Loan screening and default prediction with machine learning and deep neural networks,"The discussion focused on aspects such as interpretability, data bias, ","sensitivity to the hyperparameters,  data treatment and",dynamic calibration.,"It is considered that interpretability is one of the most relevant aspects to be considered in a  model. Interpretable models build-up trust. Interpretability is key to ensure transparency and accountability for regulators. Machine learning models need to be explained and the effect of variables better understood. If they perform slightly better, but they are opaque they won’t be considered. Theoretical support is required, that is, each variable needs to be explained economically or financially, as it was the case of the connectivity and community variables in the use cases.
For example, connectivity variables were useful to predict default risk, however, there is no clarity about how it would function for the acquisition of obligations of new companies not included in the construction of the models.
At the same time, we discussed about regularization processes, which aim to generate a trade off between bias and variance on model prediction and a simpler model. Focusing on regularization neglects parameter estimation and consequently the model loses interpretative power.
Derived from the interest of the Bank of Spain in interpretability, we explained the different alternatives of explainability in machine learning models: such as partial-dependency graphs, permutation feature importance, shappley additive explanation, Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations, researches on regularizing Black-box models for Improved Interpretability, among others. We identify a research opportunity on explainability, propose them to work on it and contact them later to explain the results.
In the subject of bias in the data, the regulators considered vital to know the details about the measurement and construction of the indicators in the models, together with their validation in the case of companies.
These proposals require a thoroughly characterization of the sample and evidence of its representativeness of the population under study. This characterization, reduces the possibility of introducing sampling and algorithmic biases.
The regulators were also concerned about the hyperparameters used in the machine learning models and how they affect the performance of the model. It is discussed that finding a “good” set of hyperparameters using cross validation (for example, nested cross validation) and meta-heuristic optimization is important. Differences in terms of performance using “good” sets are often negligible.
In the aspect of data processing, it is highlighted the importance of having a consistent position regarding the treatment of outliers, data imputation and missing data. We comment that some machine learning methods are  robust when dealing with outliers, such as decision trees or SVM when increasing margin width.
The incorporation of the temporal dynamics of the analysis event and the variables used is also demanded, as is the incorporation of forward looking elements.
","It is considered important to build models and evaluation tools through interdisciplinary teams (alliances and strategic synergies) between different actors such as Banks, Fintech, regulatory bodies, researchers (research centers and universities), information sources administrators. This,ensures the consistency, implementation, vigilance and transparency of these modeling proposals.

Its construction has used certain assumptions that assume a homogeneous (proportionality) network. Therefore, they suggest evaluating how robust the conclusions can be in the face of changes in the network structure and construction. They also mention than in the use case of banks they would be able to create the network with exposure data and are interested in the models for testing them with their data.
An aspect that they consider relevant for this type of models is sensitivity analysis, being able to simulate shocks on the included variables and identifying the most affected companies or banks, which allows them to foresee measures in that case of relevant consequences.
Regarding the second topic, they consider that the macroeconomic variables also have a component of endogeneity that has not been contemplated in the model. The global (i.e. international) dimension of the banks is highlighted, so that their variables must go beyond the country dimension in its relation with macroeconomic components, for example, in a very simple way, obtain the average GDP of the countries in which they have banking obligations.
They consider extremely important for the models to be explainable from theoretical point and with parameter values reasonable. To illustrate this argument, they say that they tests a vast battery of models, they discard all those in which the signs of the variables do not make sense.
Finally, it is suggested the inclusion of temporal information (temporal lags), together with spatial information. In other words, combining models with these two components. They also propose to incorporate forward looking elements. Furthermore, they suggest the use of a sequential approach, trying to anticipate which bank could have problems and what would be the effect of that bank in the network, in other words, they carry out a simulation.
","As an alternative proposal, they suggest investigating relationships between banks derived from companies they share through credit obligations, and how these relationships are associated with the risk of bankruptcy. In other words, they suggest studying interbank “second-order” relationships. Study the interconnections of banks with other financial actors. 
It is important to mention also that three types of public have been identified: 
Regulators that seek to understand more about the product, how it works, how accountable it is, and how to put it in production.
Statistical and computer scientists who are concerned about the methodology, the classification performance and perhaps some inference
Econometricians who are very concerned about the methodology, the theoretical and contextual support, interpretability, among others.

",There exist significant technological gaps between regulators and fintechs which in turn might impact the extent to which novel business models actually disrupt the finance industry. ,Regulatory issues can be considered a key reason why fintechs are increasingly acting as collaborators of traditional financial players rather than significantly disrupting the industry.,"-	In the context of P2P platforms there is a great need for ensuring customer protection as due to differences in risk ownership compared to the traditional banking model, these online markets are not incentivized to have the most accurate scoring models. The network-based approaches propose by the FinTech consortium were considered very useful by the audience. A representative from the fintech industry clearly stated that a major impediment for P2P growth in Switzerland is due to the lack of trust that is associated with these new players. A novel methodological approach that can improve the ability of platforms to successfully discriminate between different risk classes can be a significant step forward to ensuring higher trust. 
-	Regulatory issues can be considered a main barrier for FinTech growth and scalability across Europe. In this context, the term “regulatory issues” includes both the existence of too strict regulation as well as the lack thereof.  Specifically, a representative from a digital aggregator operating in Switzerland stressed that there is a massive need for universal standard for data in the financial service industry as otherwise, it is very difficult for them to develop new technology for financial advisers. 
-	Strong need for uniformed data-driven fintech risk management tools; Strong need for joint training and discussions between academics/regulators and fintechs

Dependency profiles.,"Determinants, dynamics and management of sovereign risk (contagion, political and macroeconomic factors)","The regulator agreed with the use of bond spreads at 10yr or bond CDS spreads at 5yr versus bund, as indicators of sovereign risk and confidence. For the latter, they suggest to interpret them with caution as they postulate a deterioration in their liquidity. However, according to the authors, liquidity is not an issue, since the data correspond to quotes generated by bond market makers (i.e., banks that continuously quote these bonds). Therefore, the correlations that are extracted with the model reflect the parameters of the factor model that these banks use for quoting. In this sense, they show the ""correlation sentiment"", i.e. the market makers' view of the correlations. ","The regulator were satisfied on how ""contagion"" is measured, considering it to be novel and elegant proposals, either with correlation influence in the first case, or through Kendall tau, copulas, and Bayesian statistics in the second. They carry out similar exercises, but mostly with the well-known correlation coefficient. They value positively the fact that the time structure has been incorporated into the measurement of ""contagion"" or dependence on the indicators of sovereign risk through: Analyzing the dynamics of measurement at various moments in time, incorporating stationary bootstrap methodologies and almost inferential elements, in the first case.  And through a more robust estimation method that recognizes the structural change of the probabilistic behaviour of the variables and the underlying model, obtaining indicators of contagion for each temporal instant, in the second case. Concerning the concept of contagion, they believe that there is a lack of clarity about its meaning. It is used as a synonym of terms such as spillover, correlation, convergence, among others. Thus, it demands a more detailed definition, establishing common elements, differences, limitations, and even conceptualizations that contemplate temporary causality. In the two cases analyzed, they suggest that the number of lags used is very short. In the first case, the correlation is instantaneous. In the second case, a delay is observed, so they suggest the use of longer lags since in the face of many phenomena and variables, the effects may take longer to manifest.","Regarding the analysis of the results of case 1, the difficulty of being able to use this type of analysis for preventive purposes is mentioned by the regulators. Each political event is different, and it is difficult to predict its impact. Nevertheless, they consider useful that this tool can validate, describe and explain the dynamics of risk indicators empirically in the face of particular political phenomena.  According to the authors, in general, the proposal presents predictive capacity, since negative correlations are a warning signal, showing, for example, that market makers prepare the settings of their quotation models expecting a worsening of the sovereign credit of the European periphery. The networks, therefore, show the risk perception of the most active market participants (the banks offering the tightest supply and demand spreads). Moreover, as investors act slower than market makers, correlation networks can have some predictive power. The second case is considered more useful by the regulators; they like to have a model that allows them to identify the paths and profiles that establish risk zones based on measures of contagion and some macroeconomic indicators. They point out that, although it is intuitive and almost natural to recognize the debt/GDP and the unemployment rate as determinants, they value having thresholds that determine changes in the state of risk levels over time.  The regulators support one of the conclusions of this second case. They consider that it is not surprising that markets will overreact to crises, which translates into almost instantaneous contagion, while macroeconomic factors take some time to deteriorate. The importance of each of these factors as determinants of risk indicators has differential lagging effects.","The regulators suggest complementing and comparing the analysis of the first case with the theory of econometric event analysis. And the second case with the theory of models of contagion.
In the first case, they consider that if the segmentation of historical political events is possible, which can subsequently be associated with differential dependency structures, then it would be possible to develop tools that would help to manage sovereign risk.
For events that correspond to countries' positions that are far from orthodox, affecting the convergence criteria and weakening the EU community, it is challenging to establish preventive measures. Although an increase in spreads is expected every time events of this nature occur, the estimate of the impact generated is not trivial. Perhaps, and this should be measured, the aggregation of this type of event, controlled by another series of variables, makes it possible to generate dependency and risk profiles, and why not, impact estimates on the indicators of sovereign risk.
In turn, they consider that there is another series of clearly determining events that have not been analyzed in detail. Such is the case, for example, of the ""Whatever it takes"" statement issued by the president of the European Central Bank seven years ago, whose position clearly defines a stand as a community that defends and consolidates the Euro as one of the relevant economic forces of the planet. Such statements could be gathered and studied to assess the impact on the bond market, its derivatives and risk indicators. 
The regulator has carried out exercises with macroeconomic indicators, obtaining similar dynamics in the segmentation; countries of the core, strong financially and economically, and countries of the periphery, dependent in lag of the countries of the centre and with negative contagion in the short term in front of the events of the countries of the same segment. In this regard, they suggest combining dependency measures and macroeconomic indicators to assess whether segmentations are generated that are not obtained by analyzing each of these components individually.
In the second case, it is recognized that a higher proportion of the macroeconomic policy mix can be used to improve investor confidence, improve indicators, and achieve development and financial stability. The contagion and dependence structure of other markets play an essential role, but a sustainable structural plan mitigates their impact.
They also highlight the weakness of peripheral countries in technological development and innovation indicators (R+D+I), reducing the set of economic alternatives and strategies that promote sustainability, competition and development in these countries, and they, therefore, consider that this component should be taken into account in risk models.
","It is important to note that in the regulators there seems to be a reasonable quantitative level, without knowing in detail the methodologies, they understand in general their contributions and results, allowing them to compare with what they do in their daily work, make criticisms of what is presented and propose new elements for future research.",1585068929

Dependency profiles.,"Determinants, dynamics and management of sovereign risk (contagion, political and macroeconomic factors)","In the first case, the participants appreciate having instruments that allow them to understand the transmission of effects by different political phenomena, as well as making markets segments for varying periods. However, they suggest using models that include control variables around the differences associated with markets. These variables recognize their strengths and limitations to have a more robust estimation of contagion.","In the second case, they value very highly the model because defines risk routes and segments, including dynamic estimates of contagion.",#NV,"Concerning the first case of use, they suggest analyzing other time frequencies and the dynamics of countries, particularly Spain, in the face of other different political and economic events. They also consider interesting to evaluate not only the impact of each political event but also the length of its effects, to be able to determine whether they generate transitory or permanent effects, and how their dependency structure reflects these.
For the second case, they suggest carrying out the analysis through country models since in some cases, the aggregations do not allow understanding the particular situation of each market. In turn, they suggest updating the study to identify the effects of policies, some of which have even taken longer to implement, again, controlling by the different estimates of contagion.
Likewise, they suggest a comparison not only of two moments, crisis and post-crisis but also advise to include pre-crisis moment. They considered that by not covering this period, the effects associated with the policies of governments and the European Union might be overestimated.
","The participants clarify that although the Tesoro Público, through the Subdirectorate General for Legislation on Credit Institutions, Banking and Payment Services and the Subdirectorate General for Legislation on the Securities Market and Financial Instruments, participates in the drafting of regulations affecting the financial sector, and also in the working groups that develop Community regulations, they are not directly regulators.
Through the General Secretariat of the Treasury and International Finance, it channels institutional relations with the main supervisory and regulatory bodies or bodies in which the State has a stake, in the field of the financial sector.

Data and quantitative methodology for the estimation of the risk of contagion.,Definition of the bankruptcy event. ,Practicality and other aspects.,"Data and quantitative methodology for the estimation of the risk of contagion.  The seminar participants:  Consider very interesting the use of Machine Learning tools and the use of other types of information (Big Data) for estimating interbank contagion.  Deem very appropriate the construction of a connectivity matrix approximating the exchange of credit between banks in the European Union through connectivity networks. Consider the use of spatial econometrics in the presentation and display of results to be appropriate, although not so novel. Highlight that the estimation of the connectivity matrix to be unsophisticated because it uses low granularity input data. This fact can lead to biased results in the evaluation of contagion, failure probability and the identification of its drivers or determinants.  Consider that the previous problem could be solved with data of higher quality. The consider that the BIS or the Banco de España may have data of higher quality and a greater level of detail, but assume that these data are private.  Consider it essential to present the units of the variables used, allowing them to understand the results better and gain confidence in the approaches taken. For example, the case of total assets which are expressed in logarithms, but the paper does not define what the unit of the variable is, which would allow them to infer which banks the default percentages presented correspond to. Wish to see general classification and inference statistics that complement the evaluation of the spatial econometric models. Only inferential statistics per variable are shown.  Consider that the analysis time window is short to evaluate the contagion effect. The period from 2008 to 2012 is the beginning and core of the crisis, and it is only after this period that new support agencies, policies, interventions and government aid begin to be defined (some of them are still currently under development). This aspect also affects the significance of contagion variables and macroeconomic fundamentals in the models. Believe that a cross-sectional analysis with only a year's lag in the variables can bias the analysis of contagion. The events associated with bankruptcy risk generate an ex-post impact of several periods. Therefore, they suggest to expand the number of lag periods used or to use models that collect these dynamics to improve the estimation of contagion. Suggest reviewing network analysis models based on the force of gravity. They consider that this is a methodology with elements in common with the one used in the case presented and that it could complement it theoretically and methodologically by also including spatial and connectivity components.","They consider relevant to expand its meaning. They agree that the legal status of bankruptcy insolvency, dissolution and liquidation are appropriate, but find that by not including bank rescue, the authors underestimate the default and, therefore, the estimate of the risk of contagion.  Although they recognize that aid, intervention and rescue policies in different countries were different, the help through these measures must be taken into account in the definition of default.  The institutions that are more susceptible to these measures can generate the most considerable contagion, and additionally, they present the most substantial difficulty in an intervention process. Related with this, they question the statistic on banking default presented in the paper for Spain. They consider that value overestimated the default if it only corresponds to the states or events legal of bankruptcy, of dissolution and that of liquidation.","They also comment that the effect of intervention and aid is different from that produced by an aggregate policy or reform, so they advise considering these differences in the models.","They think that the proposal valuable and consider the possibility that it could be used as an alternative for measuring contagion and estimating bank default. They agree with the results. For example, they agree with the fact that since the beginning of the crisis, macroeconomic variables became more relevant, due to interventions and reforms at European and national level. However, they suggest that new proposals should take into account what is described in points 1), 2) and 3) to have more robust, useful and usable estimates for regulators.

With the same purpose, they suggest that when updating the study in a longer window, also new policies and strategies associated with reducing the risk of bank failure should be taken into account. For example, ring-fencing, because its impact can be evaluated in combination with different conceptions of contagion and new measurement alternatives.
","Attendees demonstrate an excellent level of knowledge on quantitative analysis. Although they do not know in detail the methodologies presented, they generally understand their contributions and results. This allows them to compare with what they do in their daily work, make criticisms in a constructive manner, and propose new elements for future research.
Participants are interested in the feedback given by other European regulators and supervisors to the use cases. 
They suggest that it would be positive to involve and exchange experiences with the most technologically and financially developed banks and with actors that offer new financial products. The above is relevant for the efficient and socially sustainable development of the financial market. They consider that these entities have evolved more rapidly and adapted to market innovations. Thus, they are fundamental actors, demanders and promoters of regulatory and supervisory reforms.

(2) Static LDA can be used to estimate time-varying topic-intensities
(2) Causality identification methodologies from recent econometrics research (e.g., Athey and Inbens, Chernuzov, etc) more promising than Shapely value-based approach to achieve the kind of explain-ability needed for financial sector supervisory authorities (key intuition: central banks modify the environment with their actions, so need to understand causal mechanisms rather than environment-dependent Shapely values-based mappings).",#NV,1589734072

Such innovations can significantly disrupt existing industry structures as well as blur sector boundaries, facilitate strategic disintermediation, reinvent how existing intermediaries and financial-service providers create and offer products and services.","In the context of the payment industry, novel, technology-driven services have been introduced, that overcome some of the restrictions of the traditional payment systems, including large transfer fees, shorter client verification period, less bureaucracy to transfers, etc. The advantages notwithstanding, Fintech solutions leave the door open for many challenges such as cyber-attacks, underestimation of creditworthiness, potential for fraud, compliance concerns, consumer and investor protection issues and disrupted market integrity, which represent central points of interest for regulators and supervisory bodies.","In light of these developments and mostly due to the wide range of financial innovations, regulators are challenged to keep pace with the technological developments and to continuously assess the adequacy of regulatory frameworks. What is most challenging is making sure that regulation and supervision allow FinTechs to execute their business models without disrupting customer and investor protection as well as the overall stability of the financial system. ","- Fintechs experiences concerning the regulatory challenges they face in Switzerland should be collected and communicated to regulators
- There is a large knowledge and technological gap that exists between practitioners and regulators when it comes to the application of innovative technologies in the provision of financial services.

In order to retrieve the cryptocurrencies phenotype, the authors cryptocurrencies as financial instruments (genus proximum) and find their specific difference (differentia specifica) by using the daily time series of log-returns. The main result of the paper is the complete separation of the cryptocurrencies from the other type of assets, by using the Maximum Variance Components Split method. More, the authors observe a divergent evolution of the cryptocurrencies species, compared to the classical assets, mainly due to the tails behaviour of the log-returns distribution. ",Another use cases reports the results of investigation of the momentum and contrarian effects on cryptocurrency markets. The investigated investment strategies involve 100 (amongst over 1200 present as of date Nov 2017) cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap and average 14-day daily volume exceeding a given threshold value.,Cryptocurrencies represent a very relevant topic both for academics and regulators.
